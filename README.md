Inspired by [@ZweiDouble's tweet](https://twitter.com/ZweiDouble/status/1528733569224409090), I built this because I was too lazy to open up an image editor, check items off the list and then tally them up myself. I instead decided to spend probably more time building a tiny React app to do it all for me.
